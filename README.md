# EE599-Final-Project
## Project Title
Obfuscating Web User Search Queries via Generative Adversarial Privacy

## Team Member: 
Jiang Zhang, Zhongxuan Ruan, Mengwei Yang

## Team Roles:
* Jiang Zhang:  Implement the basic GAP architecture, including one generator and one adver-sary.
* Zhongxuan Ruan:  Prepossess AOL dataset and convert word tokens in queries into featurevectors.
* Mengwei Yang:  Investigate DNN models in GAP architecture.
* All team members will work on the final presentation, slides, and report.  And they will contribute equally to this project.

## Required Environment:
Pytorch 1.4, Python 3.6+, ...

## Notes:
* Please run `git pull` and fix your local conflicts, before you upload your commits using `git push`.
* If you want to keep something locally without being uploaded to github, add them into `.gitignore`.
